Colour of line and fill
EduShape.draw_shape()
Temp fix: Hardcoded the colours

Moving shapes when many have been selected
Not possible right now
Just the one you drag with mouse moves, rest get deselected

When multiple shapes are selected, and we toggle, all get toggled;
Instead it should get all to same mode on first click, then toggle from next



TODO
Change whole location system
Rather than just saving coordinates, convert them into a 16:9 format
In that way reszing window will zoom in and out rather than losing material
Will also have to see how to change all touch coordinates to that.

Change the cursor icon when above a reshape circle

Look into undo functionality
