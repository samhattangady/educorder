Colour of line and fill
EduShape.draw_shape()
Temp fix: Hardcoded the colours

Moving shapes when many have been selected
Not possible right now
Just the one you drag with mouse moves, rest get deselected

When multiple shapes are selected, and we toggle, all get toggled;
Instead it should get all to same mode on first click, then toggle from next
Maybe only applicable for this build.
When we add different colours for lines and fill, may not be applicable...

Selecting a line
Not really looked into it, just applied basics which may not even be right
Selection works away from self.x, self.y. But near that point doesn't select
Also scope for division by 0, especially if vertical line, width=0

Text needs to wrap around the box.

Look into main boxlayout.
Time to move to final layout and look of the app.


TODO

Figure out how to connect menu to canvas

Change whole location system
Rather than just saving coordinates, convert them into a 16:9 format
In that way reszing window will zoom in and out rather than losing material
Will also have to see how to change all touch coordinates to that.

Change the cursor icon when above a reshape circle,
and in other cases. Like in drawing mode etc.

Look into undo functionality
