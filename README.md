Educorder is an attempt to reduce the size of video files specifically for educational videos.

Educational videos, like those on KhanAcademy etc, generally consist of a person drawing on a tablet/computer screen and not much else, but they are still uploaded as videos which are slow to stream on bad internet connections, and it is not very feasible to store large number of these for quick and fast distribution.

What Educorder tries to do to fix this problem is to create a simple software similar to Powerpoint in a sense, where the recorder has the tools to draw basic primitive shapes and write text on the screen. This is recorded and then converted into a simple format which needs a special player to play, but the size of the files should be much smaller.

This project uses Python and Kivy.
